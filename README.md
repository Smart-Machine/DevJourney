*Learning never exhausts the mind.*

## Frontend ## 

We will be skipping HTML and CSS. A good source for documenting on those two technologies will be:

[Learn HTML](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-html.html)

[Learn CSS](https://www.w3docs.com/learn-css.html)

[Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/)

### Starter pack for Frontend

* JavaScript
    
    It is mandatory to be familier with JavaScript. There are several resources for it be learned, but the most appropiate one is the following one: 
    * https://www.w3docs.com/learn-javascript.html

    After some theory, some practice is required. Thus, a mini project for practice is given.

    ```
    Create the frontend of a blog page, or online shop page, 
    or anything else similar that crosses your mind.
    Your website should not be too simple, you will have 
    to add Authentication on the website in the future, 
    among other things. A simple page of text, it is not enough. 
    You will have to have buttons, multiple pages, 
    animations done only in CSS, event listeners 
    hand-written by you in JavaScript and so on.
    Try to combine what new you've learned.
    ```

* React.js

    The past experience of pure JavaScript will be a great background of knowledge for this step. Thus, skipping the above step is forbiden. 

    In order to create a more responsive layout, with less effort, we will be using `React.js`.

    Sources from where you can learn it:
    * [How I learned React JS in 7 Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaUj-NCDu7c)
    * [React JS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8)
    * [React State Management](https://youtu.be/-bEzt5ISACA)
    * [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#try-react) 

    Now that you know a bit more, try to refactor or idealy create a new website that would've clone your previous one, but with less flaws, more responsive layout and etc.

    As a bonus, try to hook up the React.js with Firebase, for a real time Database. 

    Optionally:

    ### Learn code bundlers ###
    - One of the most popular code bundlers for JavaScript is [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)

    ### Learn SSR react ###
